<h1>Machine Learning Handwritten Digits Recognition</h1>

<p>In this project, we developed a machine learning model to recognize handwritten digits. We used a map data structure to easily add and remove different features for dimensionality reduction. The dataset used for this project is from the sklearn datasets library.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>From the input, we make a map with all features, so that each entry is a feature vector. Each vector element is the return value of a feature function which receives the image matrix as input.</p>

<h2>Visualization</h2>

<p>To show the feature's quality and contribution to the classification process, we plot graphs of individual features and combinations of features. This visualization helps in selecting the most important features and finding relationships between them.</p>

<h2>Evaluation Metrics</h2>

<p>At last, we print some evaluation metrics such as a confusion matrix to show the classification made. These metrics help us in measuring the accuracy and performance of the machine learning model.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This project was a great learning experience for us, as we got to explore the world of machine learning and its applications in image recognition. It was interesting to see how different features can be used for dimensionality reduction and improve the accuracy of the model. We plan to continue exploring and experimenting with more advanced machine learning models and techniques in the future.</p>
